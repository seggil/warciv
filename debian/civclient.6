Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player
becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
To become the greatest civilization.

aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.

Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is
easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there!

This is the client program used to connect to a Freeciv server - See also

.SH OPTIONS
.I civclient
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along with the
additional options listed below. Those may not be combined; that is,
"civclient -np caesar 5556" will not work, instead you would need to enter
"civclient -n caesar -p 5556". All options have a short form (single
hyphen and single letter) and a long form (double hyphen and a complete word);
their effects are identical.
