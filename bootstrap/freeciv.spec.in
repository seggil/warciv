%description
Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each 
player becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the 
ultimate goal: To become the greatest civilization.

one aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.
Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and 
enthusiasts, and is easily one of the most fun and addictive network 
games out there!

of units and cities.  This makes control faster, which is good for
multiplayer war games. Pepclient feature are added and enhances that.
