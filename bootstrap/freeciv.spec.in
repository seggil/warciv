%description
Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each
player becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the
ultimate goal: To become the greatest civilization.
Players of Civilization II by Microprose should feel at home, since
one aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.
Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and
enthusiasts, and is easily one of the most fun and addictive network
games out there!
Warclient is modpack Freeciv that enhances the client''s control
of units and cities.  This makes control faster, which is good for
multiplayer war games. Pepclient feature are added and enhances that.
