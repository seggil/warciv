BUGS
====

Freeciv 2.0.9 is a "stable" release and is considered bug-free enough
for everyday use.  However if you do find a bug, we would really like to
know, so that we can fix it.  This file lists known bugs in this release,
and gives information about reporting new bugs.

This lists only the most obvious bugs.  For a complete list, see:

    http://rt.freeciv.org/

KNOWN BUGS:
===========

 - Your CMA settings are only sent to the server when you press
   turn done, and therefore changes you make to CMA in the same
   turn as you save a game will be lost.

 - The easy AI is not easy enough for novice players.  If the AI is
   beating you up early in the game, try setting the "generator" server
   option to 2 or 3.  That is, in the server, before starting a game,
   type:  set generator 2
   or:    set generator 3

 - The hard AI is not hard enough for very experienced players, and
   still does some stupid things.  E.g., it prefers leaving cities in
   revolt rather than letting them starve/shrink.

 - Sometimes there may be too many advances in the "goal" menu of
   the science report, such that the menu goes off the bottom of the
   screen and you cannot select some items. This affects the GTK+-1.2
   client only.

 - You may sometimes get the messages
	{ss} player for sample <01> not found
	{ss} player for sample <01> not found
   when using the esound sound driver. This is nothing to worry about.

 - If you hit ctrl-c in the client while using the esd sound plugin,
   the currently looping sound may not be properly aborted.

 - Some effects of wonders and research first take effect the turn
   after. Fx when building the lighthouse some triremes will only get
   the movement bonus the next turn.

 - The Xaw client can only display 25 citizens in the city dialog.

 - The autoattack generally doesn't work very well.

 - When planning a goto in the server, fx for an autosettler or an
   airplane, the server will use knowledge not available to the player.

 - In the GTK+ client, sometimes the area near the minimap contains
   garbage.

 - Automate routines like auto explore don't handle triremes very well.

 - LOG_DEBUG doesn't work with non-GCC compilers.

 - When setting server variables, the server in many cases doesn't
   check the values as well as it could.

 - Bad things happen when you manipulate multiple global worklists
   simultaneously.

 - Even in singleplayer the AI will get a chance to move both before
   and after the human player each turn. This will sometimes give the
   impression that the AI moves twice.

 - The Xaw client does not work well with the KDE window manager.
   Try using the GTK+ client or another window manager.

 - There are some bugs with research in team mode.

 - With sufficiently unusual map parameters it is possible for map generation
   to fail when the game is started.  The server will exit when this
   happens.  Try using the same parameters again or switching to more
   "regular" parameters.

 - Using the CMA in games with a timeout will cause the client to track the
   time remaining incorrectly.  The result is the turn will end while the
   client claims there is still time remaining.  Even without the CMA there
   is a small amount of error in the time tracking.

 - Pressing turn-done in games with a timeout near to the end of the turn
   may result in the server not processing the turn-done until the start
   of the next turn.  The result is that the server thinks you pressed
   turn-done for the new turn.  (This is particularly annoying in conjunction
   with the timer bug above.)

 - Transported units do not work with watchtower vision, and will desynch
   the fog of war.  None of the provided rulesets allow transported units on
   land, so this won't affect the default play.

REPORTING A BUG:
================

(If it is a bug in a translation, it should be mailed to the Primary
Contact for the language.  See <http://www.freeciv.org/index.php/Localization>
for the names and addresses of these people.)

Here's what to do:

 - Check that it is not one of the known bugs listed above!  :-)

 - Check the Freeciv website, to ensure you're playing the latest
   version.  (We may have already fixed the problem.)

 - Check the Freeciv Bug Tracking System at:

        http://rt.freeciv.org/

   to see if the bug has already been reported.

 - Submit a bug report through our bug tracking system above!

   If you get any GDK/GTK messages (they look like this:

     Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkobject.c: line 1163 (gtk_object_ref): 
     assertion oject->ref_count > 0' failed.

   ) please restart your client and append "-- --g-fatal-warnings" to
   the command line. Unfortunately this only works with a current CVS
   or with version 1.15 or better. You will get a core dump this
   way. Please include in your bug report the "stack trace" of this
   core dump.

   What to include in your bug report:

   - Describe the problem, including any messages that were displayed.

   - Indicate which client(s) you are using (GTK+ or Xaw).

   - Tell us the name and version of:

       - The Operating System you're using.  You may find the
         "uname -a" command useful.

       - The version number of Freeciv.

       - If you are using the GTK+ client, the version numbers
         (if you know them) of your GTK+, GLib, and imlib libraries.

       - If you are using the Xaw client, the version numbers (if you
         know them) of the X libraries, the PNG library, the Z library,
         and the Xaw library, and particularly whether it is standard
         Xaw, or a variant such as Xaw3d, Xaw95, or Nextaw.

       - If you're compiling from source code, the name
         and version number of the compiler.

       - If you're installing from a binary package, the name of
         the package, the distribution it's for, and where you
         got it from.

   - If Freeciv "dumps core", then we may ask you to use a debugger to
     give us a "stack trace".  You'll need the "core" file for this as
     well as the binary which you used, so please backup both.
