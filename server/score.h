/* In the terminology of the Glicko rating system,

 * the constant 'c' so that a player's rating becomes
 * completely unreliable (RD=350) if that player does
 * not play for a year.
 *
 * The formula to calculate a new c value is given by
 *
 * c = sqrt((350^2 - 50^2) / t_u)
 *   = 346.410162 / sqrt(t_u)
 *
 * where t_u is the number of ratings periods in
 * the time that it takes for a player's rating to
 * become completely unreliable (in our case t_u =
 * 365, i.e. the number of days in a year). */
