Kurz:      Amiga V1.17 - Freeciv 1.13.0
Requires:  OS 3.0, guigfx.library, MUI 3.8, NList, TCP/IP Stack
Version:   1.17

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a native compile of Freeciv. It also has an own client which is
using MUI. That means you don't need to have ixemul.library or a XServer.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - 68020 or better processor
 - OS 3.0
 - MUI 3.8
 - NList 0.89
 - TCP/IP Stack (Miami, AmiTCP, ...)
 - guigfx.library (needs render.library version 30 itself)

Note, that some combinations of the picture.datatype and ilbm.datatype don't
work correctly.
Following combinations seem to work:
  picture.datatype 43.764 (CGFX) and ilbm.datatype 44.19 (by Stephan Rupprecht)
  picture.datatype 43.33 (P96; also works on AGA) and ilbm.datatype 44.19
  picture.datatype 44.19 and ilbm.datatype 44.8 (both are in OS3.5)
  picture.datatype 43.41 (P96 V1.43a) and ilbm.datatype 40.3 (orginal OS 3.1)
Please contact me if you use other datatypes and Freeciv works correctly
with them.

Also always use the latest guigfx.library. The current version is 18.0
and this can be found at:
 http://www.neoscientists.org/~bifat/binarydistillery/guigfxlib/guigfxlib.lha
or Aminet

Render.library can be found at
 http://www.neoscientists.org/~bifat/binarydistillery/renderlib/renderlib.lha
Again. guigfx.library version 18.0 needs at least render.library
version 30. Other (newer) guigfx libraries may require later versions.

Please also let Freeciv open on a big enough screen. A screen with the
size of 640x256 is not enough (at least at the moment)

Usage
~~~~~
Freeciv is a multiplayer game and divided into sever and client. But
of course it's also possible to play freeciv on a single machine.

The first step is to start your TCP/IP stack (e.g. Miami). You don't
need to go online if you only want to play Freeciv on a single machine.
The next step is starting the server and then the client. You can do
this eighter with help of the Workbench or from the Shell (Freeciv
allocates hopefully enough stack itself so you needn't set a high
stack value). After the client has been loaded you can connect to the
server.
Alternatively you can start the server and the client with the provided
Freeciv.start shell scripts. Before it loads the server and client it
opens a filerequester where you can choose whether to load an old game
or start a new game.

For more details on usage view the other README and HOWTOPLAY files, which
are also included in this package.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please look into the doc directory for some more documentation. But note
that the Amiga Version might differ in some things.

Authors
~~~~~~~
The authors who are participated in the Freeciv project are listed in the
doc/PEOPLE file.

The Amiga Version of the client was created, as well as the server was
compiled, by Sebastian Bauer. If you have question or problems with this
version, feel free to ask me. Starting with 1.13 I got help from
Dirk Stoecker <stoecker@epost.de>. Very much thanks goes to him.

Future
~~~~~~
 - keep the work up-to-date

Notes
~~~~~
This version is incompatible with the previous version 1.12. That
means with the included client you cannot connect to a old server. Also old
clients cannot connect to the included server.

Also note that no localefile are included and there is no extra archve
because the tools to create them I have are too old.
