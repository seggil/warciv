legend=_("The P'urhepecha are a people native to the modern Mexican state of\
 Michoacan, the heart of a former empire known to them as Irechecua\
 Tzintzuntzani, meaning the \"lands of Tzintzuntzan,\" their capital city.\
 Their kings were the perennial enemy of the Aztec empire, who attempted an\
 unsuccessful invasion of the P'urhepecha lands. When the Spanish arrived\
 began their conquest of Mexico in 1519, the Aztecs sent an embassy seeking\
 the support of the P'urhepecha, but was refused. The conquistadores'\
 reputation preceded them and the P'urhepecha offered to become a subject\
 state of the King of Spain rather than meet the same fate as their former\
 enemies, the Aztecs. Nevertheless, the transition to Spanish rule was not\
 smooth and devolved into violence. The empire, founded around 1450 CE,\
 collapsed in 1521.")
