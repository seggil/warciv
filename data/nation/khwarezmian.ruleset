legend=_("Known by the Greeks as Chorasmia, Khwarezm was an urbanized,\
 centralized, and militarized state south of the Aral sea in Central Asia,\
 controlling portions of the Silk Road. It was loosely controlled as a\
 satrapy under the Achaemenid and Sassanid Persian dynasties and was mythic\
 homeland of Zarathustra, the founder of Zoroastrianism. Following the\
 introduction of Islam, Khwarezm tended to be devided into two seperate\
 kingdoms, but was united under the Turkic Anushtegihidy dynasty, which\
 lasted from 1097 until Chinggis Khan conquered it in 1231.")
