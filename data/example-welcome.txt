#
# Example Welcome Message File
#
# 
# The welcome message is the string the server displays to all
# newly connected players.
# 
# The following escape sequences are understood:
#   %v - Freeciv version running on the server
#   %p - Port the server is running on
#   %h - Hostname of the server (blank if it does not exist)
#   %d - Current date
#   %t - Current time
#   %% - A single '%'
#
# Lines beginning with '#' are ignored. To have the server
# use a welcome message file, use the command /wmessage <file>.
#

# Equivalent to the default welcome message.
Welcome to the %v server running at %h port %p.
