; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the

; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more

; special movement costs for rivers:
;   0 - normal movement cost for rivers (matches Civ1)
;   1 - 1/3 movement cost, but only when moving exactly along rivers,
;       diagonal moves incur full terrain movement costs (matches Civ2)
;   2 - 1/3 movement cost directly along river, 2/3 for diagonals (this
;       is effectively the same as '1', as if you had done the two moves,
;       except for differences relating to ZOC, etc.)
;   3 - 1/3 movement cost for any river to river move (classic Freeciv)

; Below: The individual terrain types, one per section.
; For now, the number of such sections must be kept the same (=12).
; Also, terrains should be in the same order as defined in common/map.h,
; and have similar roles/effects, as some things are still hardwired.
; The actual tag used (the * in [terrain_*]) does not matter, except 
; it must be unique for each terrain, and it may be used in debug
