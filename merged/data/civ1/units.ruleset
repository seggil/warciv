; - Cavalry: in character, but could overwhelm unlucky opponents.
; - Militia: not much good for exploring, but an ok initial unit.

Settlers may work together to decrease the amount of\
 time required for long projects.  If two or more Settlers\
 are both working on the same task in the same square,\
 their efforts will be added together each turn until the task is\
 finished.  Be careful not to dedicate too many workers to one task,\
 though; excess effort can be wasted, and a group of Settlers\

 halved, and the surrounding squares are subject to nuclear fallout.\

TIP 1:  Nuking the ocean will not generate fallout, and is a most\
 effective (but expensive!!) way of getting rid of enemy\
 ships.\

TIP 2:  You may be involved in a situation where you've invaded an\
 enemy country en masse, but the enemy cities are too strong.\
 Before using a Nuclear unit, assemble a gang of Settlers\
 next to the city and have them ready to fix\
 the fallout on the same turn it occurs!  This minimizes the\
 chance of nuclear winter.  Eco-friendly nukes!\
