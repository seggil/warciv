.SH DESCRIPTION
Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player
becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
To become the greatest civilization.

Players of Civilization II\*R by Microprose\*R should feel at home, since one
aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.

Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is
easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there!

This is the client program used to connect to a Freeciv server - See also
.IR civserver (6)

This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details
regarding the options when using
.B civclient
see the Client Manual which can be found at
.UR
http://www.freeciv.org/
.UE
as well as the documentation which is part of the Freeciv distribution.
.SH OPTIONS
.I civclient
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along with the
additional options listed below. Those may not be combined; that is,
"civclient \-np caesar 5556" will not work, instead you would need to enter
"civclient \-n caesar \-p 5556". All options have a short form (single
hyphen and single letter) and a long form (double hyphen and a complete word);
their effects are identical.
.TP
.BI "\-a, \-\-autoconnect"
Skips the connect dialog, automatically inserting the default values. This is
quite convenient when all has been set up properly.
.TP
.BI "\-d \fIlevel_number\fP, \-\-debug \fIlevel_number\fP"
Sets the amount of debugging information to be logged in the file named by the
.I \-l
option. Acceptable values for the \fIlevel_number\fP are:

\fB0\fP    for fatal messages only.

\fB1\fP    for fatal and error messages.

\fB2\fP    for fatal, error and normal messages.

\fB3\fP    for fatal, error, normal, and verbose messages.

.TP
.BI "\-h, \-\-help"
Prints a short summary of the command line options.
.TP
.BI "\-l \fIfilename\fP, \-\-log \fIfilename\fP"
Defines a log file, \fIfilename\fP, to be produced during processing. Use the
.I \-d
option to set how much is logged.  By default, fatal and normal messages are 
printed to standard output.  With a log file, such messages go to the log
instead.
.TP
.BI "\-m \fIaddress\fP, \-\-meta \fIaddress\fP"
Specifies the \fIaddress\fP of the metaserver to connect to. A metaserver is a
place where Freeciv servers can publish their presence. Freeciv clients consult
the metaserver to offer users a selection of games to join. By default the 
standard Freeciv metaserver is used. 
.TP
.BI "\-n \fIstring\fP, \-\-name \fIstring\fP"
Specifies the name (\fIstring\fP) to play under. This option is critical when 
reconnecting to a game. Please note that you might need to quote your playername.
.TP
.BI "\-p \fIport\fP, \-\-port \fIport\fP"
Specifies the server \fIport\fP to connect to. By default this is 5555, if in 
doubt ask the server administrator.
.TP
.BI "\-P \fIstring\fP, \-\-Plugin \fIstring\fP"
Specifies the plugin to use for sound output.  Available options  for 
\fIstring\fP are:

\fBnone\fP

\fBesd\fP

\fBsdl\fP

.TP
.BI "\-r \fIfilename\fP, \-\-read \fIfilename\fP"
Specifies a file, \fIfilename\fP, of server commands which the server will 
automatically read and process, as if you had typed them in at the server's 
prompt. (for spawned server only)
.TP
.BI "\-s \fIaddress\fP, \-\-server \fIaddress\fP"
Specifies the game server \fIaddress\fP to connect to. This server might easily
run on the same machine as the client.
.TP
.BI "\-S \fIfilename\fP, \-\-Sound \fIfilename\fP"
Specifies the \fIfilename\fP to read the sound tags from.
.TP
.BI "\-t \fIstring\fP, \-\-tiles \fIstring\fP"
Specifies the tiles to be used within the game by supplying the name 
(\fIstring\fP) of the tilespec. See the \fIFILES\fP section below for tilespecs
included with this distribution.
.TP
.BI "\-v, \-\-version"
Prints the version number and exits.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.TP
.B civclient \-\-name "King Richard" \-\-server io.daimi.aau.dk
Starts the client using the name \fIKing Richard\fP and connecting to the
server at \fIio.daimi.aau.dk\fP.
.TP
.B civclient \-a \-t trident
Starts the client with the \fItrident\fP tiles and autoconnects to the 
\fIlocalhost\fP.
.SH FILES

\(bu
.I isotrident.tilespec

.I trident_shields.tilespec
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The Freeciv client accepts these environment variables:
.TP
.BI FREECIV_CAPS
A string containing a list of "capabilities" provided by the server. The
compiled-in default should be correct for most purposes, but if you are familiar
with the capability facility in the source you may use it to enforce some
constraints between clients and server.

the directory where the files are placed by running "make install".
