; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the

; use your new customized file.

; The AI does not know the value of Partial_Invis, nor does this
; work against the AI, since it knows all. It does not know anything 
; about air units at all. It does not build No_Land_Attack, Missile 
; or Nuclear units.
;
; You should sort role units from worst to better, as often the best
; available role unit of a given sort will be picked by choosing
; the first available (not obsolete) such unit, or by picking the last
; such unit directly.

 as well as production, and a Settler can die if its supporting city\
 runs out of food.\

Settlers and Engineers may work together to decrease the amount of\
 time required for long projects.  If two or more Settlers and/or\
 Engineers are both working on the same task in the same square,\
 their efforts will be added together each turn until the task is\
 finished.  Be careful not to dedicate too many workers to one task,\
 though; excess effort can be wasted, and a group of Settlers and/or\
