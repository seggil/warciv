freeciv (1.9.0-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non maintainer upload.
  * Make the client packages depend on freeciv >= 1.9 (closes: #49667).
  * Disabled building of the empty freeciv-xaw package which made no sense.
  * Added --cache-file option to configure invocations to speed up the 
    build process.
  * Installed HOWTOPLAY into each package since it is quite small compared 
    to the overall size of the software (closes: #36091).
  * Made the whole beast FHS compliant (closes: #49506).
  * Installed changelog into each package (lintian).
  * Made a doc directory for each package.
  * Removed icon="none" from menu files (lintian).
  * Added #DEBHELPER# to install/remove scripts.
  * Removed calls to update-menus from scripts because debhelper already 
    takes care of this and there is a small time penalty on (de)installation.
  * Updated location of GPL license in copyright file.
  * Made civ.1.gz a slave of civ so that man civ will work (closes: 47352)
  * Checked old bug reports:
    - Help window stays after reconnecting (closes: #48016)
    - /usr/games/civ is not any longer a script but maintained by the 
      alternatives system (closes: #25589)
    - civclient-gtk is dynamically linked (closes: #48017). Probably the 
      problem was the result of a defect GTK installation during the 
      build.
    - according to the logs, bug 26795 was fixed upstream (closes: #26795)
    - resizing does not produce any gaps with the current version 
      (closes: #26797)
    - dh_clean takes care of removing debian/files (closes: #32780)
    - Debian unstable version is current (closes: #38980, #48221)
  * As the freeciv-xaw package is no longer build it can't have a bug *eg*
    - the bad link is not anymore (closes: #48214)
    - update-xaw-wrappers is not needed/called anymore (closes: #24108)
    - another problem with xaw is a non-issue (closes: #26396)
    - We do not care for alternatives vs. xaw-wrappers anymore (closes: #31907)
    - The new xaw-wrappers config format does not tangle us (closes: #37111)
    - Non-existent civclient-xaw will not segfault ;) (closes: #38368)

freeciv (1.9.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disabled the building of the freeciv-xaw package because if nobody uses
    it, it's not worth the xaw-wrappers headaches
  * Added temporary kludge to rules to install potfiles
  * Fixed /usr/man -> /usr/share/man; I'll still have to deal with /usr/doc

 -- Lalo Martins <lalo@webcom.com>  Tue,  2 Nov 1999 17:16:34 +0100

freeciv (1.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Main package (freeciv) no longer contains a client, to get rid of
    superfulous dependencies; instead it Recommends: freeciv-client which is
    a virtual package Provided by the 2 client packages (3 for the CVS
    snapshots). The xaw client is moved to the freeciv-xaw package.
  * Fixed the xaw-wrappers incompatibility (xaw-wrappers changed its
    interface since the last Freeciv release, and this made freeciv-xaw
    incompatible)

 -- Lalo Martins <lalo@webcom.com>  Thu, 10 Jun 1999 12:32:04 -0300

    use debhelper.
  * Fixes #31907 (glitch in alternatives system when interfaced with xaw3d)

freeciv (1.7.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed lots of glitches in debianization of the new status quo:
    + We no longer need the "civ" script because we now set datadir in
      configure
    + Made "civ" into an alternative, to cope with future binary packages
      freeciv-xaw3d and freeciv-gtk
    + The menu entry for the client does not point to "civ" anymore but to
      "civclient"; changed the label to state that it's the "(traditional
      Athena version)"
    + Manually stripping binaries till I get around to rewrite debian/rules
      for debhelper
  * Notice: 1.7.2-1 wouldn't work at all, if you have it you need to upgrade
