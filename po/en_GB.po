" 9. Making your own strategy for the game.\n"
"10. Interacting with other players (Diplomacy).\n"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 0. Choosing the first city site.\n"
"\n"
"    Start the game by wandering around BRIEFLY to find a good place to build "
"the first city.  Don't feel tempted to investigate any yellow-roofed "
"villages yet - they might contain barbarian tribes.  Build the city close to "
"resources and perhaps close to the sea.  Keep in mind that the city you "
"build first will be your capital!  The idea is to balance the quality of the "
"site you find against getting your first city established as early as "
"possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 1. Mapping the countryside.\n"
"\n"
"    After the capital city has been founded, it will start producing a "
"warrior unit.  These units can be used to rove around exploring the "
"countryside.  Remember, it is risky to leave a city undefended, so perhaps "
"keep the first warrior in the city, and use the following one to explore.  "
"If you started the game with an explorer unit, use that to explore, "
"obviously!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 2. Defending the cities.\n"
"\n"
"    At this point, defend your cities by always leaving a warrior unit in "
"them.  As your civilization develops units with a greater defense strength, "
"replace the obsolete units with new ones to ensure your cities have maximum "
"defense.  The units most often used for defense are (in order of strength):  "
"Warrior, Phalanx, Pikemen, Musketeers, and Riflemen."
msgstr ""

#, no-c-format
msgid ""
"    Keep in mind that with some types of government, military units inside "
"or outside cities can reduce or create unhappiness. Also remember that when "
"a unit is inside a city, it gets a 50% defensive bonus, as if fortified.  "
"When a new city is built, the city starts to build the best available "
"defensive unit from the above list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 3. Deciding which units to build first.\n"
"\n"
"    After building one or two Warrior units, start building Settlers.  The "
"second Settler can be used to build roads and irrigate the farmland close to "
"the city, and the third can be used to build a new city.  Or, you can use "
"the second Settler to build another city, and use the third Settler for "
"agricultural improvements in the farmland around the cities.  Keep in mind "
"that a large population increases both the amount of productivity and your "
"civilization's research rate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 4. Building agriculture improvements.\n"
"\n"
"    Each city has an area of farmland around it that can be used for growing "
"food, producing goods, and generating trade.  This can be increased by using "
"Settlers to improve the farmland. The land can be improved with roads, "
"irrigation, mines, and others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 5. Deciding where to build cities.\n"
"\n"
"    The best location for a city is a matter of taste.  A city which is "
"placed near the sea is easier to spot by opponents, but can also serve as a "
"port for sea-going units.  (They also usually need a coastal defense later "
"on.)  The best strategy is to build a few of both, but keep in mind that "
"your opponents will find it harder to locate your city if you don't build it "
"by the sea."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 6. Taking care of the cities.\n"
"\n"
"    Every city has a band of citizens.  The number of citizens depends on "
"the city's population.  When you click on a city, you can see how the "
"farmland around the city is being used.  You can assign your citizens to the "
"farmland, or they can be scientists, entertainers or taxmen.  Especially at "
"the start of the game, care should be taken to ensure that the citizens are "
"employed so that they maximise growth, trade and production."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"    If too much food is being generated, a citizen can be taken off the "
"farmland by clicking on the occupied farmland square.  This citizen can then "
"be transferred to the other duties mentioned previously."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"    If you move all of your citizens into the city and right-click on the "
"central tile of the farmland, the citizens will be rearranged to maximise "
"food production."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"    The golden rule of taking care of a city is that there should be at "
"least as many happy citizens as unhappy citizens.  A city where this is not "
"so is labelled with a lightning bolt.  Take care not to let this happen to "
"any of your cities, as unhappy cities produce nothing, and will soon revolt."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 7. Exploring the world.\n"
"\n"
"    After you have fortified your cities with troops, build Triremes in the "
"cities near the sea.  Use the Triremes to map the world in search of "
"opponents and new lands.  If you are on an island, you should spend less on "
"military and more on expansion.  Or if you are located close to an opponent, "
"it is truly a good idea to make a peace treaty and share the advances you "
"have made. Diplomatic units are very useful here, and WILL pay off later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 8. Things to keep in mind.\n"
"\n"
"  - What the next advance you'll need is.\n"
"\n"
"  - What your tax, luxury and research rates are currently set to.\n"
"\n"
"  - Treaties are often broken, so don't neglect defense...\n"
"\n"
"  - Some wonders can be made obsolete by the development of certain advances."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
" 9. Making your own strategy for the game.\n"
"\n"
"    These basic concepts will allow you to play the game pretty well, "
"especially in the beginning of the game.  But to improve, you need to study "
"the various units and advances, and PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!  Freeciv "
"has many twists, so if you haven't played a similar game before, try "
